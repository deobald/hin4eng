Hindi for English speakers

## Schedule

### Lonsdale tl;dr for Language Parents

* #5 (Language Parenting) is _very_ important
    1. work hard to understand what student is saying
    2. never correct mistakes
    3. confirm your understanding with correct Hindi
    4. use words the student knows
    5. = safe environment, simple words + body language + images
* content must be relevant (_interesting_) to student
    * talking about Swift, Raku, and SBCL is okay
* only speak in Hindi, but use simple words + body language + images (video on)
* focus on student's understanding (not vocabulary, for instance)
* enunciate
* focus on core words, if possible
* use images to explain, not English

## Hinglish?

* Try to avoid English in conversation, when possible. It's a massive context switch for a native English speaker. The example I gave Ankur was that typing in Dvorak/QWERTY is hardest when hitting `A` and `M` keys, since they map the same way in both layouts, causing automatic context switches.
* In text English is not so bad (mostly just annoying).

## Potential Non-conversational Input

## Chris Lonsdale ("Learn Any Language in Six Months")

### 5 Principles:

* consider: Attention, Meaning, Relevance, Memory
* things that are automatically relevant:
    * helps survival?
    * helps attain goals?

1. Content must be relevant to learner
2. Use language as a tool to communicate _from day 1_
3. Comprehensible Input 
    * understanding the message => unconsciously acquiring the language
4. Language is physiological
    * "expect your face to hurt"
    * you need to learn to hear the sounds
5. Psycho-physiological _state_ matters
    * bad: sad, anxious, depressed, scared, etc.
    * good: happy, relaxed, curious
    * try to be tolerant of ambiguity ("expect that you won't understand everything")

### 7 Actions:

1. Listen a lot (brain soaking)
2. Meaning > words
3. Start mixing words
4. Focus on the core
    * 1000 words = 85%
    * 3000 words = 98%
    * "what is this?"
    * "how do you say ----?"
    * "I don't understand"
    * "Please repeat that"
5. Language parent
    1. work hard to understand what student is saying
    2. never correct mistakes
    3. confirm your understanding with correct Hindi
    4. use words the student knows
    5. = safe environment, simple words + body language + images
6. Copy the face
    * video must be on
7. "Direct connect" to mental images
    * share screen
    * google image search
    * take time to look things up + show
